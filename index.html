            One afternoon, as you and your best friend Mia are walking home from school, you take a shortcut through the woods. You've done this a hundred times before, but today something is different. Hidden among the trees, you notice an old wooden door standing all by itself. There are strange symbols carved into it, and a brass handle glistens in the sunlight.
